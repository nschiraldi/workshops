After his release from prison, Barnes became a gold.miner and set up camp on Dodd‘s Creek in Douglas County near that of another miner, William Graham, Several months Bater, on April 27, 1906, Barnes moved to a point several miles away on Tuller‘s Creek and set up a new camp.. The next day, he borrowed a rifle from a neighbor saying that he planned to go hunting and that night, while talking to two visitors at his camp,remarked that Graham was a bad man who he would not hesitate to kill, He left early the next morning before his visi= tors had awakened, and was seen going in the direction of Graham‘s camp» That night, he appeared in Glendale and payed a bill with a special piece of gold that had been molded for Graham, receiving cash in exchange for the difference in the value of it and his account,  While drinking in a saloon, he displayed a pistol which another man knew to be Grgham‘s and when éskedpabgut it he said‘ that he had pur=  chased it from Graham, On the morning of May 1, a ¥mwm skeleton, the flesh consumed by fire, was found near Graham s camp and nearby was a hat and other articles of clothing belonging to Graham, The body was identified bs that of Graham because the skeleton corresponded to his size and by the presence of the items known to have been worn by Graham when last, seen, When taken into custody, Barnes denied that he had killed Graham and, in spite of the fact that he had previously told a man that he had recently purchased the pistol, he said that it had been his for some time, While awaiting trial, he attempted to escape from jail, ‘At his trial, his defense was based on uncertainty as to the identity of the skeleton and lack of motive for murder, He did not take the stand in his own behalf and he was convicted and sentenced to die, The case was unsuceessfully appealed to the State Supreme Court and when Governor Chamberlain declined to commute the sentence, he was hanged at the State Prison on Sept, 18, 1906, He went to his death calmly and made a brief speech .in which he said: ""Gentlemen, this is not going to be an execution; this is murder, I expect to die like a man, Although Governor Chamberlain has not saw fit to pardon me, I am ready to die, But, this not an execution; it is murder,"" He then asked that hymn number 5 from the prison song book KNXKXX be sung but, as no person present knew the song, this re»  uest was denied 85 PACIFIC 998 — OREGON JOURNAL.

When he saw that she was dead, he walked to a nearby barber shop where he got a shave and a haircut and then to the police station where he surrendered, in— forming the office® at the desk that he had just killed his wife with a hatchet.

On the morning  of March 28, 1905, Megorden went to the County Beat at Vale, return«— ing about noon and putting his team away,. He then went to Nyssa  where he spent the afternoon, That night, in the presence of the four children, he asked his wife if she planned to cook for him anymore, She replied that she had never said that she would not and he then told her that he wanted her to leave the premises the next morning, She answered that she would not as she had as much right to be there as he, He then went over and began shaking his fists in her face in  a threatening manner and when he attempted to strike her, Robert  hit him in the head with a 22 caliber rife, breaking the stock and knocking him to the floor, Megorden immediately arose and ran into  the bedroom and got his pistol from a trunk, Mrs, Megorden t     He fired three shots at Robert, none of which took effect and then overtook his wife, As she begged him not to shoot, he fired one bullet into her breast, killing her instantly, Megorden then went Nyssa where he saw a physician about his own wound after which he told him that he had shot his wife and asked him to go see her, Robert and Olive had, in the meantime, taken their mother‘s body  to a neighbor‘s house and Megorden was arrested shortly afterwards, At his trial, he maintained that his wife had threatned him with a stick of stove wood which he was trying to take from her when Robert struck him and that the blow had so dazed him that he did not rea— lize what he was doing, However, both Robert and Olive testified against him and the State presented some physicians who said that the blow could only have dazed him for a few moments,. His conviction was appealed to the Oregon Supreme Court on the grounds that he was not allowed to challenge some of the jurors for actual bias and the failure of the judge to make certain defense requested charges to the jury, The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction and he was hanged at the Oregon State Prison on June 28, 1907.  80 PACIFIC 306",B21_OR_000061a.png; B21_OR_000061b.png,https://archives.albany.edu/concern/daos/3x8174904,https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/c534g583s; https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/jh344973h,true,77970; 77971; 77972; 77973; 77974; 78336; 78337; 78338; ,B33_F006_000079.jpg; B33_F006_000080.jpg; B33_F006_000081.jpg; B33_F006_000082.jpg; B33_F006_000083.jpg; B33_F011_000014.jpg; B33_F011_000015.jpg; B33_F011_000016.jpg; ,https://archives.albany.edu/concern/daos/p8419203k; https://archives.albany.edu/concern/daos/rv043678p; https://archives.albany.edu/concern/daos/ng451x242; https://archives.albany.edu/concern/daos/pc289x73d; https://archives.albany.edu/concern/daos/2227n377w; https://archives.albany.edu/concern/daos/1c18dv741; https://archives.albany.edu/concern/daos/4t64h2149; https://archives.albany.edu/concern/daos/8s45qp869,https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/ff365j867; https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/5999nh41k; https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/bv73cc524; https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/fq9787645; https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/8s45qp84r; https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/h128nt72c; https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/td96kg627; https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/zs25xp741,2019-06-04 17:15:36 UTC,2019-06-04 17:15:36 UTC,https://archives.albany.edu/description/catalog/apap301aspace_8be0e1de7701331de249f0bd14bd6294,https://archives.albany.edu/description/catalog/apap301aspace_f0853bfb698f764f09ba0a9293d8c585,https://archives.albany.edu/description/catalog/apap301aspace_d1f83d0369c3eb641cdfa73d0a87a46b; https://archives.albany.edu/description/catalog/apap301aspace_f9a4a4eb3df3c0089964fc0506d2bc62

Roselair, a 6—year=ocld white man, was a native of Holland who emi— grated to the United States and settled at Hillsboro, Ore., where he worked for a number of years as a fish peddler before he purchased  a ranch in the timber land ten miles above Buxton, After his first wife died, their daughter left him and secured a position as a domes= tic servant, giving as a reason the fact that he freqiehhly had beaten and KKK abused both her and her mother, He married again and became the father of several children but his second wife managed to secure a divorce because of his constant mistreatment, In the fall of 1908 he met and married Lisette Dombrower, a 23—yearecld waitress in a Portland restaurant and shortly afterwards they moved to his ranchs The union was an unhappy one, even though she quickly became pregnat, because Roselair was cruel and had an overbearing disposition, On the morning of May 15, 1909, they got into an argument at the break» fast table because she had served him milk from which the cream had been skimmed, When she threw the pan of milk at him, he grabbed a  20 inch salmon knife and hacked her repeatedly, He then cut her hroat so deeply that her head was almost severed from her body and (ofan ther Amit i A burning her‘ bloody clothing and her bodg, he cleaned up the blood stains and  stayed around the house until late that evening when he rode into Hillsboro and surrendered himself to the Sheriff,.

He said that he accidentally cut her and then finished killing her to ""put her out of her misery,."" His congic» tion was unsuccessfully appealed to the Oregon State Supreme Court and when the Governor declined to grant clemency he was hanged in the Oregon State Prison on Sept. §, 1910. Prior to his trial, his grown daughter, the child of his deceaged wife went to visit him and after she left, she explained that she had done so not out of sympa— thy but to see if he sincerely atoned for the murder and to plead with him to allow his ppoperty to be used for the support of her young half brothers and sisters, Roselair had little to say on the gallows but as the noose was being adjusted, he broke down and cried  until the trap fell, His neck was broken,  109 BactrIc 865 EILLSBORO AKUS, Hillsboro, Ore,, August 8, 1910; May 20, 1909",B21_OR_000072a.png; B21_OR_000072b.png,https://archives.albany.edu/concern/daos/gf06gk799,https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/3n204g18n; https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/f18823992,true,78094; 78336; 78337; 78338; ,B33_F007_000079.jpg; B33_F011_000014.jpg; B33_F011_000015.jpg; B33_F011_000016.jpg; ,https://archives.albany.edu/concern/daos/pc289x75z; https://archives.albany.edu/concern/daos/1c18dv741; https://archives.albany.edu/concern/daos/4t64h2149; https://archives.albany.edu/concern/daos/8s45qp869,https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/db78ts34n; https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/h128nt72c; https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/td96kg627; https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/zs25xp741,2019-06-12 19:27:51 UTC,2019-06-12 19:27:51 UTC,https://archives.albany.edu/description/catalog/apap301aspace_8be0e1de7701331de249f0bd14bd6294,https://archives.albany.edu/description/catalog/apap301aspace_f0853bfb698f764f09ba0a9293d8c585,https://archives.albany.edu/description/catalog/apap301aspace_13b03bb19a174d100c52a44f4c7bd300; https://archives.albany.edu/description/catalog/apap301aspace_f9a4a4eb3df3c0089964fc0506d2bc62

Shortly ___ afterwards, he enticed a 2l;—year—old Harlan girl, Alma Nesbitt, and ""her mother, Loulsa, to come to Oregon and establish the neighboring _ homestead.

She said that she had written to him in the early part of 1900 and had received a reply, from Alma requesting information as to whether or not she was divorced, At Williams‘ trial the prosechahtion maintained that Alma had left him when she discovered that hermarriage was bigamous and that Williams had lured her and her mother back to the ranch he kllled them, temporarily buried the _ bodies under the site of the hen house which was subsequently built, and then, after aftaining enough brush and dead wood, cremated the bodies in the large bonfire. His motive was a double one — the de= sire for her homestead and his fear that she would have him arrested for bigamy, Williams was convicted of the double murder, but &he appealed the case and delayed his execution until July 21, 1905, when he became the Llagt man in the ~tate of Oregon to be publicly hanged.

Esbert, a ?7—year—old white man, was born John H, Frost in Audubon ‘Co., Iowa,. Adopted in infancy by a family named Egbert, he was given the name Harry D. Egbert, but in later life occasionally used the name Jack Frost as an alias, After graduating from high school, he entered his first criminal venture when he operated an illicit saloon in a dry city, He subsequently moved to Oregon in 1900 and in Oct,, 1901, was sentenced to the penitentiary there for horse theft, In the summer of 1903, a warrant was issued for his arrest for a burgla«= ry committed at Drain Oregon, In September he was traced to the Juni—= per ranch near Burns in Harney County and a warrant was sent from Douglas County for his arrest,. Deputy Sheriffs Jack Saxton and John West went to the ranch to serve the warrant and allowed Egbert to en— ter the house to say goodbye to the woman with whom he was living in a comman—~law relationship,. He sscaped through a rear window and made his way to the KXKKk Fields ranch in the Wild Horse Section where he was again located on October h}, When Saxton and West arrived there, he opened fire op them from within the house and West was felled by  his first shots, Saxton managed to make his way to the house and he and Egbert continued firing at each other through the wails. Vests  mortally wounded, pleaded for water and when Saxton took him some, Egbert shot and killed him from an upstairs window, He fled into Nevada and was tracked from there to Rockland, Idaho, by a constable who was stimulated by the reward and arrested there on October 26, His conviction was not appealed and at 12:2 on the afternoon of Jan. 29, 1904, he became the first man to be executed at the Oregon State Prisonyin thepresence of 75 witnesses. Egbert never lost his nerve even. though he was deathly pale and nerouyvsly puffed on a cigarette as he mounted the gallows unassisted after eating a last meal of canned pears and cream as he had requested, He mde a—brief speech from the gallows in which he urged witnessesto keep their children out of saloons and away from bad company and closed with the words:? ""My heart is too full to say anything more,"" Several of the witnesses left the room before the black cap was placed over his eyes and one of the witnesses, a medical student, fainted as the trap fell, As his body was not claimed by relatives or friends, it was given to the Medical College at Willamette University for dissestion,  TIMES—HERALD, Burns, Oregon, Jan, 30, 1904 and Feb, 6, 1901. j PORTLAND ORRONIAN, Portland, Ore., Jan, 30, 190}; (Photo on page six) HARNEY COUNTY, OREGON, AND ITSRANGE LAND by George Francis Brimlow, Published, 1951, by Binfords and Mort, Portland, Oregons Page 220",B21_OR_000023a.png; B21_OR_000023b.png,https://archives.albany.edu/concern/daos/dz0117623,https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/8g84n448w; https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/6969zh777,true,78334; 77463; 77464; 77465; 77466; 78329; 78330; 78331; 78332; 78333; 78335; 78336; 78337; 78338; 97883; 97884; 97885; 97886; ,B33_F011_000012.jpg; B33_F002_000138.jpg; B33_F002_000139.jpg; B33_F002_000140.jpg; B33_F002_000141.jpg; B33_F011_000007.jpg; B33_F011_000008.jpg; B33_F011_000009.jpg; B33_F011_000010.jpg; B33_F011_000011.jpg; B33_F011_000013.jpg; B33_F011_000014.jpg; B33_F011_000015.jpg; B33_F011_000016.jpg; B44_F001_000092.jpg; B44_F001_000093.jpg; B44_F001_000094.jpg; B44_F001_000095.jpg; ; B33_F002_000137.jpg,https://archives.albany.edu/concern/daos/8623jb70t; https://archives.albany.edu/concern/daos/xd07h6198; https://archives.albany.edu/concern/daos/j098zq88w; https://archives.albany.edu/concern/daos/th83mc53h; https://archives.albany.edu/concern/daos/c534g236s; https://archives.albany.edu/concern/daos/2801pw47g; https://archives.albany.edu/concern/daos/v979vg19c; https://archives.albany.edu/concern/daos/x633fd500; https://archives.albany.edu/concern/daos/cv43p9848; https://archives.albany.edu/concern/daos/9k41zs866; https://archives.albany.edu/concern/daos/v405sq52w; https://archives.albany.edu/concern/daos/1c18dv741; https://archives.albany.edu/concern/daos/4t64h2149; https://archives.albany.edu/concern/daos/8s45qp869; https://archives.albany.edu/concern/daos/1z40m821w; https://archives.albany.edu/concern/daos/c534g380j; https://archives.albany.edu/concern/daos/1r66jg30c; https://archives.albany.edu/concern/daos/hm50v703v; https://archives.albany.edu/concern/daos/5d86pc64x,https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/76537f47c; https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/8336hf75z; https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/bc386z42v; https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/js956v91d; https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/mg74r081v; https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/k643bd507; https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/73666j385; https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/x633fd518; https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/wd376903q; https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/vq280273j; https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/qf85nr017; https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/h128nt72c; https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/td96kg627; https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/zs25xp741; https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/qf85ns20n; https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/v979vh38s; https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/rn301g683; https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/m900p833w; https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/d504s066c,2019-05-08 19:30:44 UTC,2019-08-09 15:24:01 UTC,https://archives.albany.edu/description/catalog/apap301aspace_8be0e1de7701331de249f0bd14bd6294,https://archives.albany.edu/description/catalog/apap301aspace_f0853bfb698f764f09ba0a9293d8c585,https://archives.albany.edu/description/catalog/apap301aspace_f9a4a4eb3df3c0089964fc0506d2bc62; https://archives.albany.edu/description/catalog/apap301aspace_f4f09805e374ab0c23f52d9589ca7fd3; https://archives.albany.edu/description/catalog/apap301aspace_9a8bd265219ac4aa204626569839175e
