At his trial, he maintained that the pistol had discharged accidentally while he struggled with another man,. However, the other man denied this and the physical evidence disproved it so he was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to die. After the Alabama Supreme Court upheld the convic— tion, the Governor commuted the sentence to life imprisonment and Cobb was moved from death row into a csll in Kilby Prison which he shared with another black prisoner named Jesse Porter, Both men were assigned to work in the prison cotton mill and one morning in 1918 Cobb walked from where he was working in the mill to the spot where Porter was working, grabbed him by the shoulder and turned him around , and stabbed him in the neck inflicting a mortal wound. Cobb confessed to officers that he and Porter had been having a homosexual affair which, the night before, Porter had XKKSXXXKSX threatened to discontin— ue and that for this reason Cobb had killed him, At his trial he de» nied having said this and stated that Porter had threatened to kill him on the night before because he had refused to lend Porter money  with which to buy dope. He claimed that Porter had been accidentally stabbedin a struggle for possession of the knife during a fight which had been started by Portel. Convicted and senter nced to die under an Alabama Statute that provided the death penalty for any prisoner serving a life sentence who committed murder, the convic— tion was upheld by the Alabama Supreme Court and Cobb was electro— cuted at the Alavama State Prison on March 11, 19219 12 3 20 SOUTHERN REPORTER 2nd SERIES 713. c a ag j= 38 SOUTHERN REPORTER 2nd SERIES 279 257 ﬁg}? ra 4?” T #8.",B19_AL_000027a.png; B19_AL_000027b.png,https://archives.albany.edu/concern/daos/70795r734,https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/3f462q041; https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/4j03dg25g,true,443; 446; 447; 448; 7592; 7593; 7631; 7656; 7656; 7228; 7201; 7202; 7229; 7230; ,B01_F003_000154.jpg; B01_F003_000157.jpg; B01_F003_000158.jpg; B01_F003_000159.jpg; B02_F009_000063.jpg; B02_F009_000064.jpg; B02_F010_000023.jpg; B02_F010_000048.jpg; B02_F010_000048.jpg; B02_F006_000053.jpg; B02_F006_000026.jpg; B02_F006_000027.jpg; B02_F006_000054.jpg; B02_F006_000055.jpg; ,https://archives.albany.edu/concern/daos/4t64gv89z; https://archives.albany.edu/concern/daos/gm80j2737; https://archives.albany.edu/concern/daos/cz30q1195; https://archives.albany.edu/concern/daos/bc386r96x; https://archives.albany.edu/concern/daos/n296x6152; https://archives.albany.edu/concern/daos/n009w9007; https://archives.albany.edu/concern/daos/db78tm16p; https://archives.albany.edu/concern/daos/9z9037047; https://archives.albany.edu/concern/daos/9z9037047; https://archives.albany.edu/concern/daos/wp988t88s; https://archives.albany.edu/concern/daos/ws859q236; https://archives.albany.edu/concern/daos/cn69mc02g; https://archives.albany.edu/concern/daos/3r075270j; https://archives.albany.edu/concern/daos/t722hh773,https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/p8418v67q; https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/qf85nj648; https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/9880vz365; https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/gt54kv786; https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/wh2471135; https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/hq37vw971; https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/w3763f588; https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/0z7094290; https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/0z7094290; https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/8910k358z; https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/fb494h377; https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/t722hh76t; https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/ng451r49w; https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/00000686t,2019-06-07 19:26:10 UTC,2019-06-07 19:26:10 UTC,https://archives.albany.edu/description/catalog/apap301aspace_8be0e1de7701331de249f0bd14bd6294,https://archives.albany.edu/description/catalog/apap301aspace_f0853bfb698f764f09ba0a9293d8c585,https://archives.albany.edu/description/catalog/apap301aspace_4b6451fa294db110408afd673daeff0d; https://archives.albany.edu/description/catalog/apap301aspace_280a853067a30f7adbe493e2ec862dbc; https://archives.albany.edu/description/catalog/apap301aspace_94831371bf6e2b083d9a7c952e72c75f

Walton in Hale County,. He and a fellow worker, Ernest Johnson, had discussed killing Walton before and on the morning of Feb, 8, 1915, they broke into his house while he had gone tn town and stole a shotgun, a pis— tol, some shells and bullets, When Walton returned and started to unlock his door, Brown, who was hid at the side of the house, shot him with the shotgun. When they went over the check the body, they noticed a movement of* Walton‘s hand and Johnson told Brown to shoot him again, Brown then shot him with the pistol,.

When motorman Kelsie Morrason went to Linten‘s sesistance, he shot him also, inflicting a serious but not mortal wund, Caldwell immediately fled to the mountains where he was taken into custody the next night by a detachment of military police, His conviction for the murder was appealed to the Alabama Supreme Court and affirmed and then his attorneys asked  the U, S. District Court to set aside the verdict, contending that  he should have been tried by Court Martial, Their refusal to do so was appealed to the United States Supreme Court which held that the state courts were supreme except at the actual scene of war, A strong effort for clemency was made with Attorney General A, Mitchell Palmer,  who contended that he had not received a fair trial, and President Woodrow Wilson both asking for clemency from the Alabama Governor, The Governor also received numerousp@itions from Anniston, including the city‘s leading clergymen and the dead man‘s widow, demanding that ﬂyﬁhé law be allowed to take its course, He finally refused to commute the sentence and ah noon on July 30, 1920, he was hanged in the yard o the Calhoun County Jail in the presence of the widow of the man he had killed held an infant daughter, born after her father‘s death, in her arms, Beffre the execution, he was, allowed to address the ' 2,500 persons assembled in front of the jail, He read the 23rd Psalm, sang two hymns and delivered a proxyter bafore the‘crowd.

In the Fall of 1901, they met on First avenue in Pirmingham and Charleston drew a revolver and emptied it in Hardy‘s body. Hardy, who was one-legged, made an unsuccessful attempt to es— cape but was hindered in doing so by his infirmity, After the killing Charleston made the statement that he wished that Hardy had another life so that he could kill him again, His defense was self—defense as he claimed that Hardy had threatened to kill him on a number of occasions, but when it was shown that the murdered man was unarmed, Charleston was convicted and sentenced to die, He was hanged before a large crowd in the Jefferson County Yail Yard at Birmingham on Sept. 5; 1902 fFrior to his executlon, he made a rather eloquent address from the scaffold which he closed with a prayer.

He then wandered off into the woods and managed to escape capture for two days after which he was taken into custody and charged with the murder, He never denied his guilt though he continued to maintain that the murder had occurred because of false accusations of theft and he was convicted ahd sentenced to die, At his execution at Seale on June 26, 1886, he made a speech from the gallows in which he confessed murdering Reems in anger and warned other young men not to marry more than once and got to tell women that they loved them unless it was true. hi closed his ‘talk by saying: ""I hope my death will save ten thousand,",B19_AL_000039a.png; B19_AL_000039b.png,https://archives.albany.edu/concern/daos/6108vt80k,https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/9p290t59s; https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/r494w344p,true,7353; 7354; 7642; 7643; 7714; 7715; 7716; 97814; 97815; 97816; ,B02_F007_000059.jpg; B02_F007_000060.jpg; B02_F010_000034.jpg; B02_F010_000035.jpg; B02_F010_000106.jpg; B02_F010_000107.jpg; B02_F010_000108.jpg; B44_F001_000023.jpg; B44_F001_000024.jpg; B44_F001_000025.jpg; ,https://archives.albany.edu/concern/daos/1r66j811x; https://archives.albany.edu/concern/daos/sf268d25f; https://archives.albany.edu/concern/daos/9593v306k; https://archives.albany.edu/concern/daos/1z40m1982; https://archives.albany.edu/concern/daos/6969z768m; https://archives.albany.edu/concern/daos/st74cz746; https://archives.albany.edu/concern/daos/4x51hs239; https://archives.albany.edu/concern/daos/th83md982; https://archives.albany.edu/concern/daos/b2774941z; https://archives.albany.edu/concern/daos/n583z9750,https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/r781wq400; https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/79408485s; https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/xk81jt30h; https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/c821gs89v; https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/7d279224s; https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/zw12zd44h; https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/1v53k523z; https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/x059cp010; https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/xd07h7606; https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/2514p1958,2019-06-10 15:56:42 UTC,2019-06-10 15:56:42 UTC,https://archives.albany.edu/description/catalog/apap301aspace_8be0e1de7701331de249f0bd14bd6294,https://archives.albany.edu/description/catalog/apap301aspace_f0853bfb698f764f09ba0a9293d8c585,https://archives.albany.edu/description/catalog/apap301aspace_280a853067a30f7adbe493e2ec862dbc; https://archives.albany.edu/description/catalog/apap301aspace_9a8bd265219ac4aa204626569839175e

The argument and murder occurred in the presence of several other convicts, all of whom testified against Fletcher at his trial and he was convicted and sentenced to die, After his conviction, a physician was sent to his cell by the Governor of Alabama to test his sanity and the physician ruled that he was sane and accountable for his actions.

After his arrest, there was con— siderable local indignation, and a lynching was averted only by  the prompt actions of the local authorities, Convicted and sen— tenced to be hanged on August 18, 1899, he was granted a respite  by the Govelmor when he received an affidavit from one of the jurors to the effect that he had been influenced.

Winston in Lacy Beat, Sumter Co., Ala., in January, 1896, He had repeated disputes with the overseer of the plantation, a white man named A, F.

Because of the doubts that his testimony created in the minds of the jury, Duncan received a life sentence, but M.ller‘s conviction, based largely on Adams‘ deathbed statement resulted in his receiving a death sentence, He financed an expensive legal battery by the instigation of ""an endless chain letter‘ ""scheme whereby each recipient of a letter sent him ten cents and contimed to maintain his innocence as well as that of Duncan, His appeals were all rejected and when the Governor declined to intervens, he was hanged at the Jefferson County Jail in Birming— ham on June 28, 1901, From the gallows, he reiterated that Duncan, gig-sad go stand trial later that year for the murder of Kirkely, tried for the murder of Mune yas not  a Z, a C4.

The Sheriff assured him that there was not, and one of the several thousand blacks outside the burlap bagging that had been erected around the gallows shouted: ""You needn‘t be afraid of anything of that sort,"" After the cop and noose had been placed over his head, he remarked: ""Hanging is might bad, but if a man is ready, why let it be over with as quick as possible and all will be right and well,"" His last words, spoken just before the trap fell, werer ""I am ready,"" His neck was  broken by the fall gnd KKX he was, pronounced dead in 11 minutes, #p hirer? f} j 0&ch i/ Soe 252707",B19_AL_000121a.png; B19_AL_000121b.png,https://archives.albany.edu/concern/daos/qz20t9545,https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/3j333k55j; https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/zs25xs78r,true,2106; 2107; 2108; 2109; 2110; 2111; 7506; 7507; 7610; 7642; 7643; 7719; 7720; 97821; 97817; 97818; 97820; ,B01_F019_000010.jpg; B01_F019_000011.jpg; B01_F019_000012.jpg; B01_F019_000013.jpg; B01_F019_000014.jpg; B01_F019_000015.jpg; B02_F008_000087.jpg; B02_F008_000088.jpg; B02_F010_000002.jpg; B02_F010_000034.jpg; B02_F010_000035.jpg; B02_F010_000111.jpg; B02_F010_000112.jpg; B44_F001_000030.jpg; B44_F001_000026.jpg; B44_F001_000027.jpg; B44_F001_000029.jpg; ,https://archives.albany.edu/concern/daos/nz806639w; https://archives.albany.edu/concern/daos/wh247074p; https://archives.albany.edu/concern/daos/d791sp61s; https://archives.albany.edu/concern/daos/0r967b422; https://archives.albany.edu/concern/daos/qv33s4395; https://archives.albany.edu/concern/daos/p5547z73m; https://archives.albany.edu/concern/daos/1g05fk81n; https://archives.albany.edu/concern/daos/3n204567q; https://archives.albany.edu/concern/daos/zc77sz28v; https://archives.albany.edu/concern/daos/9593v306k; https://archives.albany.edu/concern/daos/1z40m1982; https://archives.albany.edu/concern/daos/zs25xh95r; https://archives.albany.edu/concern/daos/xk81jt322; https://archives.albany.edu/concern/daos/js956x33x; https://archives.albany.edu/concern/daos/f7623v375; https://archives.albany.edu/concern/daos/hm50v727f; https://archives.albany.edu/concern/daos/vd66wd933,https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/wh247073d; https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/wm117w42g; https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/cz30q129d; https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/2r36v506q; https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/9880vz518; https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/k3569c106; https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/kk91ft532; https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/hh63t3787; https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/ff365d209; https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/xk81jt30h; https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/c821gs89v; https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/k643b8384; https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/kp78gq31j; https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/qb98mx225; https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/fx71b233v; https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/ns064n40n; https://archives.albany.edu/downloads/nc5812912,2019-06-28 19:32:54 UTC,2019-06-28 19:32:54 UTC,https://archives.albany.edu/description/catalog/apap301aspace_8be0e1de7701331de249f0bd14bd6294,https://archives.albany.edu/description/catalog/apap301aspace_f0853bfb698f764f09ba0a9293d8c585,https://archives.albany.edu/description/catalog/apap301aspace_3db46e828ea07fb7aa8ebd5cbe44e3b4; https://archives.albany.edu/description/catalog/apap301aspace_280a853067a30f7adbe493e2ec862dbc; https://archives.albany.edu/description/catalog/apap301aspace_9a8bd265219ac4aa204626569839175e

Hale and Johnson, both white, and Rivers, a black, were residents of rural Pike Co., Ala, On the night of Dec,. 18, 1898, they went to the home of Mrs, Ira Meyers, a widow, and her daughter—in—law, Mrs, E. Meyers, also widowed,. The two wonen ran a small store near their home in Josie Bkat and were generally known to keep large sums of monsy in their house, A young hired man named Cook who lived in the same house with the two women was awakened shortly after midnight by a struggle from the elder Mps, Meyer‘s room and when he rushed in to assist her in her struggle with a man, he was knocked unconscious, When he came to, the house was on fire and he dragged Mrs, Meyer‘s body from the dwelling. He. then returned to the house and dragged out the body of the younger Mrs,. Meyers, Both women had been bru— tally bludgeoned with an ax and while the younger woman was already dked, Mrs, ira Meyers lingered for several days before she also died of her wounds,.

Meyers, also widowed,. The two wonen ran a small store near their home in Josie Bkat and were generally known to keep large sums of monsy in their house, A young hired man named Cook who lived in the same house with the two women was awakened shortly after midnight by a struggle from the elder Mps, Meyer‘s room and when he rushed in to assist her in her struggle with a man, he was knocked unconscious, When he came to, the house was on fire and he dragged Mrs, Meyer‘s body from the dwelling. He. then returned to the house and dragged out the body of the younger Mrs,. Meyers, Both women had been bru— tally bludgeoned with an ax and while the younger woman was already dked, Mrs, ira Meyers lingered for several days before she also died of her wounds,. The house and all of its contents were com— pletely consumed by the flames, Hale and Johnson wers taken into  custody on suspicion and lodged in the county jail at Troy where  tivers and several other blacks were also being held for investiga— tion, Rivers finally broke and confessed that he had been at the scene of the crime, but he swore that he was forced to accompany Hale and Johnson who he named as the actual killers, stating that they stole several thousand dollars in currency before setting fire to the dwelling in the belief that the bodies of the occupants and all traces of the crime would be d&stroyed.

A clerk immediately reported the theft to Policeman Eugene Hobbs and shortly afterwards Hobbs stopped Cunningham in an alley to question him, Cunningham drew a straight razor and slashed Hobbs repeatedly in the throat, inflicting fatal wounds, Cunningham then ran from the alley and Hobbs staggered out, calling to passersby to stop Cunningham, He was subsequently captured in another alley where he had taken refuge and was taken to Hobbs who lay dying on the ground and identified Cunningham as the man who had cut him, Cunningham maintained that he had only held Hobbs while another black man did the cutting but the subsequently admitted that he alone was involved, A mob formed and the Sheriff hastily drove Cunningham out of town and, in a circuitous manner, took him to Odean, twenty miles distant, where he planned to flag a freight train and take him to the Annison jail, The crowd anticipated this mogd—and caught the train at Sylacuaga,.

Boyington had left Mobile and, as he was the last person seen with Frost, he became the immediate suspect. He was captured a few days later at Claiborne, Ala., on a river boat headed north and just be— fore he was takep into custody, he was seen to XHEEXKKXX throw a watch resembling one missing from ""rost‘s body overboard,. He was also found to have a considerable sum of money in his possession  and he was known to be virtually penniless previously,. Returned to Mobile, he was tried, convicted and sentenced to die for having mur— dered his friend for the purpose of robbery, Though he steadfastly denied his guilt, Boyington offered very little defense and, as. he was convicted on clrcumstantlial evidence, it is gust? beliefireé by many that he was innocent,.

A  few weeks after Polly Ann‘s death, another daughter named Shirley Di— ann was born to the Weldon‘s and this child became a great favorite | of the childless Mrs, Dennison. On the afternoon of May 1, 1952, af— ter she had finished her shift at the Wetumpka hospital, Mrs, Denni son drove to rural Claud, Ala,, to visit the, Weldons, She took Shir— ley Diann to a neighborhood store where she purchased some soft drinks and candy, When they got back to the Weldon house, Mrs, Dennison went into the kitchen and prepared the sodas for ShirleyyDiann, ""rs, Wel— | don and herself, carefully pouring the child‘s into a plastic cup.

An examination of the plastic cup showed traces of arse—. nic and it was found that Mrs, Dennison had purchased some arsenic in. a drug store three weeks earlier, An exhumation of Polly Ann Weldon‘s body disclosed that she two had been poisoned with arsenic and a check revealed that Mrs, Dennison had collected on an insurance policy on her life, Several days after her arrest, she confessed that she had poisoned. Shirley Diann, but she claimed that it was not tatéd, but done on an impulse, She denied that she had killed Polly Ann or her husband, Though his body was never and an autop— sy performed, it was generally believed that she had poisonedhim also, Convicted and sentenced to death, her attorneys requested a — ”aﬁnitf test whilh ruled that she was fully sane.

After attempting to speak twice and failing, he finally managed to say> ""I appreciate everything everybody has done for me and every— thing.""
